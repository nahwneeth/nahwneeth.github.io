> Hello, and welcome to my modest corner of the web!

People call me Navaneeth. That's my actual name as well (lucky me?). Staring at the screen and pushing keys in a particular order is my crack and I'm still trying to comprehend why I love it so much.

I constantly type my thoughts into [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (my textual rubber duck?). This blog is it's distilled version. You'll find made-up scenarios solved in an opinionated (possibly wrong?) style.

Professionally, the tech I've worked with (in order):
- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
- [Android](https://developer.android.com/docs)
- [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
- [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/)

This blog is an unnecessary addition to my life that'll make me spend a bit more of my free time in front of a screen. Still, when I look back I don't remember the things I've spend my time on. With my obsidian being a mess (literally), this blog provides me that rough timeline I need.

Hopefully, this blog thing is easy? xD
